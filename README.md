# zBlog

An open blogging platform where users can create and control their own blogs.

## Todo

* Stop hardcoding domains (& subdomains)

* Blog management features:

  * Delete blog. Possibly a data export when deleting

  * Change theme(?)

  * Track metrics (views, unique views(?))

  * Manage comments (allow, disable, possibly delete?)

* Generally available features:

  * Create comments on others' blogs if allowed (possibly must be signed into account to do this)

* MD editor/viewer should syntax highlight code
