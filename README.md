# zBlog

An open blogging platform where users can create and control their own blogs.

## Todo (Basically all functionality)

* Users can create 1+ blogs

  * Accessible through the unique subdomain of their choosing

  * Need some way of limiting so nobody makes a billion blogs and reserves all the subdomains

    * Possibly max active blogs per user. Can add more by deleting existing ones

    * Pay to increase max count(?)

* On their own blog, can create new posts using a markdown/WYSIWYG editor

  * Title, content, tags(?)

* Anyone should be able to read any blog, but only the blog's creator should be able to manage it

* Blog management features:

  * Change name

  * Delete blog. Possibly a data export when deleting

  * Change theme(?)

  * CRUD posts

  * Track metrics (views, unique views(?))

  * Manage comments (allow, disable, possibly delete?)

* Generally available features:

  * Create comments on others' blogs if allowed (possibly must be signed into account to do this)
